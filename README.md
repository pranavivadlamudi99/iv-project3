# Car Data Visualization

## Overview
This project is part of the Information Visualization course Project 3. We have utilized a car dataset to create various visualizations to analyze different aspects related to fuel efficiency and car attributes.

## Features
- Comparing Fuel Efficiency Across Manufacturers
- Analyzing the Relationship Between MPG and Weight
- Exploring the Distribution of MPG by Car Origin
- Visualizing the Distribution of Cars by Origin
- Analyzing Fuel Efficiency Trends Over Model Years

## Visualizations

### Comparing Fuel Efficiency Across Manufacturers
Users can compare the average MPG of cars produced by different manufacturers using a bar chart.

### Analyzing the Relationship Between MPG and Weight
Users can examine how MPG varies with the weight of cars using a scatter plot.

### Exploring the Distribution of MPG by Car Origin
Users can analyze the distribution of MPG for cars based on their origin (e.g., American, European, or Japanese) using a box plot.

### Visualizing the Distribution of Cars by Origin
Users can explore the distribution of cars based on their origin (e.g., American, European, or Japanese) using a pie chart.

### Analyzing Fuel Efficiency Trends Over Model Years
Users can explore the trend of average MPG (miles per gallon) over different model years using a line chart.
